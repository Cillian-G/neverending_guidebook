## UX 
UX design was intentionally kept minimalist and simplistic throughout the site. This was done to imitate the format of traditional guidebooks, and to ensure the sites design didnt get in the way of users accessing necessary information

### Colour Scheme 
This site uses shades of Forest Green (#055105) as well as Avocado (#90A955). Forest Green was chosen to provide an authoritative and minimal colour shceme, similar to the colours used by big name printed guidebooks

### Typography 
This project uses Fjalla One for its clear legibility, and authoritative style.

### Wireframes

## Features
### Existing Features
The site utilizes a patron system, in which users are required to purchase a one time "patron" upgrade whch grants access to the sites full content.
In order to allow non-patron users to get a 'taste' of what the guidebooks content looks like, posts can be made available to non-members via the preview system. A destination's patron status can be toggled by site admins, allowing for a rotating selection of patron content to encourage patron-signups
The site also implements a bookmark system which allows signed-in users to bookmarks posts to revisit later.
The site has a nesletter signup form which allows users to subscribe to email updates.
The site also has a contact form which allows users to make contact with site administrators to suggest corrections to listings, as well as query an issues with their accounts.

### E-Commerce Business model
This sites e-commerce business model is bult around its patronage system. It aims to compete with major printed guidebooks by setting its price just below the cost of common guidebooks like lonely planet, or rough guides. Users are encouraged to upgrade to patron level accounts with a rotating selection of preview content listed on the homepage. This content is visible to all, which gives users a taste of the kind of content available on the full site. 

By operating with a one-time purchase of $25, the site aims to compete with major printed guidebooks, and also markets itslf as a lightweight alternative to carrying several large bulky guidebooks around in one backpack
