    <h2>Welcome to the last guidebook you'll ever need!</h2>
    <p>
        The Neverending Guidebook is an online travel guide for travel lovers who want to leave bulky guidebooks behind. 
        Instead of buying an expensive guidebook (or multiple!) for each trip, TNG offers guides to an ever-expanding, globe-spanning range of destinations, 
        at less than the cost of 1 traditional printed guidebook. By becoming a patron of the site for only $25, you'll gain permanent access to our patron-only  
        articles. Your patronage will help support guidebook writers on their travels, as they contine to expand this incredible resource!
        If you're interested, start by signing up for a free account. Once you have an account, click "Become a Patron!" above, and start the journey of a lifetime!
