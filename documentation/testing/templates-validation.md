- HTML errors Caused by content source
The content in location listings was copied from wikitravel, an open source wikipedia style online guidebook. The formatting of this copied content causes some HTML errors, which are not the result of my own code. These errors are only occuring because of the source of the placeholder content I am using, not due to my own code.
